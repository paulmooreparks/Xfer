</ This is a sample Xfer document. It demonstrates the basic syntax and features of the Xfer language. />

<// Elements are formed by enclosing them in angle brackets with another inner marker to designate
the meaning of the element. For example the character pairs </ and /> are used to enclose comments. 
When, as is the case here, the marker is repeated, it is so that the element can contain an embedded 
element of the same type. In this case, the outer comment contains an embedded comment, so the marker 
character, '/', is repeated as many times as necessary to allow embedded elements to be properly 
distinguished. //>

</ The following element is a metadata element. It consists of key/value pairs, some of which have 
reserved keywords (version, message_id, and ttl). If a metadata element is provided, it must be 
the first non-comment element in an Xfer document. />

<! version "1.0.0 message_id `|COMPUTERNAME !>
<"""foobar""">
</ The outermost element of an Xfer document is an implicit property-bag element. It may contain 
elements of any type. />

</ A string element is a sequence of characters which are rendered literally, as they appear. />
<"Hello, Xfer!">

</ An evaluated element evaluates its embedded elements. The following will render as I ❤ Xfer. />
<` I <\$2764\><\$fe0e\> Xfer `>
