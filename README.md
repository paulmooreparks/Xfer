# The Xfer API Management CLI Tool

![Xf CLI Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xf_CLI-0.1.0-green)

The Xfer CLI tool provides a command-line interface (CLI) for making HTTP requests, scripting workflows, and easily interacting with APIs from the command line.

This repository was originally the home for the [Xfer data-transfer language](https://github.com/paulmooreparks/Xfer/blob/master/ParksComputing.Xfer.Lang). That project still exists, but I'm now using XferLang to implement the configuration for the Xfer CLI tool as well as for some internal data transfer tasks. The [core language specification](ParksComputing.Xfer.Lang/README.md) has moved into the folder that contains the assembly for the language implementation.
