# GitHub Copilot Instructions for XferLang Project

## Context Files to Reference
Before responding to any request, please read and consider the following context files:

1. **README.md** - Complete XferLang philosophy, syntax guide, and examples
2. **docs/api.html** - .NET API documentation for ParksComputing.Xfer.Lang
3. **agent/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Current project state, key concepts, and character assignments
4. **agent/STANDING_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Development guidelines and coding protocols
5. **agent/RECENT_DECISIONS.md** - Latest architectural decisions and priorities
6. **agent/SESSION_PROMPTS.md** - Additional prompts for specific development scenarios

## Project Overview
You are working on XferLang, a data serialization language with advanced processing instruction capabilities. This project uses:

- Element-based architecture for all data types
- Processing Instructions (PIs) for special directives
- Functional programming style for method chaining
- Direct .NET integration without external scripting engines

## Key Instructions
1. **Always check current file contents** before making edits - the user frequently makes manual changes
2. **Use replace_string_in_file with 3-5 lines of context** for unambiguous edits
3. **Run tests after significant parser changes** to ensure no regressions
4. **Maintain consistency** with XferLang's element-based design philosophy
5. **Update documentation files** when the user says "remember this" or gives standing instructions

## Current Character Assignments
- Query Elements: `` ` `` (backtick)
- Reference Elements: `;` (semicolon)
- Processing Instructions: `<!` `!>`
- Comments: `</` `/>`
- Dollar ($): Reserved for hex numbers
- Percent (%): Reserved for binary numbers

## Testing Requirements
- All 170 tests must pass after changes
- Use `dotnet test` to run full test suite
- Create debug applications for complex scenarios
- Clean up temporary files after debugging

## Meta Instruction
When the user explicitly states something should be remembered across sessions or gives a standing instruction, immediately update the appropriate file in the `agent/` directory and confirm the update.
